For Comp 20 Summer Session A 2017
Lab 5: My Old Kentucky Home
1) As far as I can tell, all aspects have been implemented properly. The only thing which gives 
me pause is my images which do not display with any lyrics, but at the beginning and end of the song
this was an intentional design choice because I though having both the lyrics and the image was crowded
and that the period at the beginning of the song before the singing and the period at the end after
were fairly sparse by comparison. 
2) I did not collaborate with anyone beyond my posts on piazza for this lab.
3) This lab took me approximately 2 hours to complete.
