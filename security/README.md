1) I believe all aspects of this assignment have been implemented correctly. I am still a little unsure whether I classified the NoSQL and XSS vulnerablities correctly, but aside from that it has all required aspects of a security report.
2) I did not collaborate with anyone for this assignment, although I did read all the piazza posts relevant to this lab.
3) This lab took me approximately 4 hours, but 2 of those hours were spent trying to troubleshoot issues with Burp before giving up on it.
4) This readme is in markdown format.
