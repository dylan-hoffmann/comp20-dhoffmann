Lab 10: Closest MBTA Subway Pt. 2
1) To the best of my knowledge and understanding all aspects have been completed properly. In addition to the base specifications, I also track the trains in real time and display them on the map. When clicked they give info about their destination and train number
2) I have not collaborated with anyone on this project, I did however extensively consult stackoverflow and w3schools for features which I ended up not implementing. I also consulted stack overflow for a work around for assigning eventlisteners to array elements.
3) I spent about 11 hours on this lab.
