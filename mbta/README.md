Lab 8: Closest MBTA Subway Pt. 1
1) To the best of my knowledge and understanding all aspects have been completed properly
2) I have not collaborated with anyone on this project, I did however extensively consult stackoverflow and w3schools for features which I ended up not implementing.
3) Is too long a valid answer? I spent about 15 hours on this lab.
